Considerations for more in-depth organization information:

For a client organization to be considered fully onboarded and ready for system ATOs, several key elements need to be in place:
Security Governance Framework
This serves as your master blueprint. It should include the organization's security vision, objectives, and how security aligns with business goals. For small-medium businesses, this typically includes documenting the security organizational structure, roles and responsibilities, and decision-making processes. You'll want to template key positions like:

Information System Security Manager (ISSM)
Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
System Owners
Data Owners

Policy Framework
This forms the bedrock of your security program. Essential policies that should be templated include:

Information Security Policy
Access Control Policy
Incident Response Policy
Business Continuity Policy
Acceptable Use Policy
Data Classification and Handling Policy
Change Management Policy
Third-Party Risk Management Policy

Security Risk Management Program
This encompasses your threat model and risk assessment framework. It should document:

Risk Assessment Methodology
Risk Acceptance Criteria
Risk Treatment Plans
Risk Register Template
Threat Model Framework
Vulnerability Management Process

Security Operations Framework
This outlines how security is implemented day-to-day:

Security Monitoring Strategy
Incident Response Procedures
Business Continuity Plans
Disaster Recovery Procedures
Configuration Management Process
Change Control Procedures

Training and Awareness Program
A templated program should include:

Security Awareness Training Materials
Role-specific Training Requirements
Training Schedule and Tracking Method
Security Communication Plan

Compliance and Audit Program
This establishes how the organization maintains and demonstrates compliance:

Compliance Requirements Register
Audit Schedule
Evidence Collection Procedures
Control Assessment Templates
POA&M Management Process

Asset Management Program
Before diving into specific systems for ATOs, you need:

Asset Inventory Template
Asset Classification Schema
Asset Lifecycle Management Process
Configuration Baseline Standards

Third-Party Management Program
For managing vendor and partner relationships:

Vendor Assessment Templates
Contract Security Requirements
Third-party Monitoring Procedures
Service Level Agreement Templates
